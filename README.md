# On the Alignment of DAO with Socio-political principles of Decentralised Governance using TOGAF and ArchiMate
Authors: Julien Hue, Irina Rychkova, Nicolas Herbaut

## Abstract
BC technology enables new organisational models, e.g. DAO and implementation of decentralised governance mechanisms, such as LD in respect to anarchist principles. 
However, it is hard to demonstrate the traceability between socio-political artefacts, the governance processes and the technological artefacts enabling these processes. 
Enterprise Modeling and Enterprise Architecture framework are traditionally used to demonstrate and analyse the alignment between technology and organisational strategy. 
Yet little research addresses the alignment between socio-political artefacts and technological artefacts in decentralised organisations, such as DAOs. 
In this work, we use ArchiMate and TOGAF to explicitly reason about processes of decentralised organisational governance grounded on anarchism and their implementation 
through BC-empowered DAOs. We apply the design science research (DSR) framework to create our research artefact, which is a reference architecture.
